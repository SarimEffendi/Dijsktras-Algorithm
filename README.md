# Dijsktras-Algorithm
 This is a program made using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest 
path for cities(vertices). User first have to enter the number 
cities(vertices) and give the names of the cities(vertices) then user have 
to enter the number of connections(edges) and then have to enter the 
connections(edges) in between the cities(vertices) and put a weight to 
it after entering these users have to tell the source city (source node) 
from which the algorithm will calculate the shortest path to every 
other city(vertex).
